#### Frequently Asked Questions

* Where can I download the App?

  * You can find the IDer app in your App Store or Google Play. Search for "ider".

* Can I hack/improve/fork/edit this module?

  * Mmmm. Even though we encourage the developing and extension of new modules it doesn't sound like a good idea in this case. This plugin has been very tested and stressed and it should be use as it is. But if you got a brilliant idea or suggestion we would love to hear from you.
